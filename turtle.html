        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>This project is about creating a graphical scene using Python’s Turtle graphics
module.I used the provided building block functions (draw_rectangle, draw_square,
draw_triangle, draw_circle, draw_polygon, draw_curve, etc.) to create functions that 
draw composite shapes such as a house. This was done my refractoring previos projects.

        <h2>Final Scene</h2>
        <p>Here's the completed turtle graphics scene featuring three houses:</p>
        
        <div class="scene-container">
            <img src="turtle-image.png" alt="Turtle Graphics Scene -  Three different colored houses on a blue sky background" class="scene-image">
        </div>
        
        <p class="scene-description">
            The scene combines multiple composite shapes created from basic turtle graphics functions. The house uses rectangles and triangles for the structure and roof, while additional details like windows and doors are added using smaller shapes. The background is filled with a blue sky to enhance the visual appeal.
